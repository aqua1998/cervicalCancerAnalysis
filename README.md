# Predicting	Cervical	Cancer	Cases	Resulting	in Biopsies Using	Ensemble Methods
This is an exploration of this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/loveall/cervical-cancer-risk-classification using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques including a random forest & gradient boosting classifers, SVM, and K-means clustering.

## Contents
The dataset is included as kag_risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv, as well as my Jupyter notebook containing the exploration of the dataset, and a final report with my findinds.

## Introduction
Cervical	cancer is	a	malignant	tumour	starting	in	the	cells	of	a	womanâ€™s	cervix,	and	possibly	spreading or	metastasizing to	other	parts	of	her	body.	Although	the	number	of	cases	of	cervical	cancer	have	been	declining	in	recent	years	due	to more	advanced	screening	and	early	detection	with	the	Pap	test,	300,000	women	worldwide	die	each	year	due	to	cervical	cancer.	My investigation of the Risk Factors of Cervical Cancer Dataset focuses on predicting	whether	a	woman	will	result	in	having	a	biopsy	due	to	cervical	cancer.


## Results
My research and analysis of the dataset resulted in the Gradient Boosting classifier having the highest accuracy, precision, and F1 measure, compared to the other 3 models.
